                <p>
                  As an Associate Director on the TV series Ma'a Waqf al-Tanfidh
                  (With Suspension of Execution), directed by Saif Sbeih and
                  produced by Ebla International Production Company, my role
                  involved taking on a leadership position behind the scenes
                  both before and during filming. I was responsible for
                  coordinating between departments, ensuring that the directorâ€™s
                  vision was executed smoothly, and managing the logistics and
                  creative aspects of the production. Before filming, I was
                  instrumental in pre-production, helping with scheduling,
                  location scouting, and organizing rehearsals. During filming,
                  I worked closely with the director and crew to oversee the
                  efficiency of the shoot, ensuring that scenes were captured on
                  time and to the highest standard. My leadership role required
                  quick decision-making, strong communication, and a deep
                  understanding of both the artistic and technical demands of
                  the project.
